We have all witnessed the evolution of communication methods from letters to chatrooms and nowadays the use of chat applications is 
quite popular.However, a person's relationships and groups have substantially risen, and this is especially true for those who work 
in the educational field.Let's use engineering CLGS as an example to illustrate the increase in number of groups, educators start 
chat groups to better connect with the students, but as they take on more classes, the number of group grows each year and the same 
is true for students as each passing year they are made to join multiple groups.Even in a group there are multiple types of messages 
like announcements about exams,holidays, time-table as well as doubts to name a few these messages are quite frequent and the 
important ones are lost in this clutter making it quite a pain to search for the message we need at the moment from that heap of 
messages.Our app Cube resolves this common problem by introducing sub-grouping.

## Appendix

This was a project which I made in my third year of college . It was my first time using this tech stack so there might be some useless and repeatative code blocks.
The color-scheme and UI of this app isn't the best (ps:I hate CSS). 
The logo for Cube isn't mine its one of those free ones availabele in Canva (Thank-you random designer you are really cool).
